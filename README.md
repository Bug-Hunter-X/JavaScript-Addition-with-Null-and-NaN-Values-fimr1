# JavaScript Addition with Null and NaN Values

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in JavaScript when using the addition operator (+) with `null` and `NaN` values.  The function `foo` aims to add two numbers, but the handling of null values is not as intuitive as one might expect.  The solution addresses this and offers improved error handling and clearer output.
